# AgentENV envd Tools Drive

This directory contains the source for the envd tools drive attached to every
Firecracker guest as `/dev/vda`.

This source is here so contributors can inspect and reproduce the tools drive
that AgentENV consumes as a prebuilt runtime asset. Normal `make start-server`
does not rebuild this image; server startup continues to download the configured
tools drive from `config/deps_manifest.toml` unless `tools.drive_path` points at
a local ext4 file.

The build is intentionally self-contained:

1. Clone and compile `envd` from `e2b-dev/infra` at `ENVD_REF`.
2. Assemble the guest tools rootfs with BusyBox, `/init`, `/agentenv/pivot-init`,
   and `/agentenv/envd`.
3. Create `/tools.ext4`.

Requirements:

- Docker with the Buildx plugin available (`docker buildx version`).
- The default `GO_VERSION` is aligned with the default upstream `ENVD_REF`.
  Override it from `docker buildx build` only if the selected envd source
  supports a different Go toolchain.

## Local Build

From this directory:

```bash
make
```

From the repository root:

```bash
make -C tools-image
```

The output is written to:

```text
tools-image/out/tools-<TOOLS_VERSION>-<ARCH>.ext4
```

## Versioning

`TOOLS_VERSION` is the SemVer release of the complete drive, including envd,
BusyBox, and the init scripts. Published versions are immutable: any byte-level
change requires a new version. `ENVD_REF` remains the upstream `e2b-dev/infra`
ref used to compile envd and is not necessarily the same string as the version
reported by the binary.

Official releases use normal versions such as `0.1.0`. Custom distributions use
a prerelease identifier that is unique within the AgentENV deployment, such as
`0.1.0-custom.1`. Do not publish different drive contents under the same
version.

AgentENV's runtime config records the expected in-guest envd version:

```toml
[envd]
version = "..."
```

After building a tools drive, use the build log to find the value printed by:

```bash
/out/envd -version
```

That is the value that should match `[envd].version`. For cross-architecture
builds, the Dockerfile skips executing the target binary in the builder; mount
the generated ext4 on a matching Linux host and run `/agentenv/envd -version`
there instead. The build also prints, for native builds:

```bash
/out/envd -commit
```

which identifies the upstream commit baked into the binary.

## Configuration

The build accepts these Make variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TOOLS_VERSION` | `0.2.0` | Immutable SemVer release of the complete tools drive |
| `ENVD_REF` | `envd-v0.6.13` | Tag, branch, or fetchable commit to build from the envd upstream repository |
| `ENVD_UPSTREAM_REPO` | `https://github.com/e2b-dev/infra.git` | Repository containing `packages/envd` |
| `ARCH` | host architecture, normalized to `amd64` or `arm64` | Target architecture |
| `PUBLISH_PLATFORMS` | `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` | Platforms included in the published OCI image |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | `out` | Directory for exported tools drive images |
| `OUTPUT_NAME` | `tools-${TOOLS_VERSION}-${ARCH}.ext4` | Versioned tools drive filename |
| `IMAGE` | `agentenv-tools:${TOOLS_VERSION}` | Local or remote image tag |
| `PUBLISH_OUTPUT` | `type=image,name=${IMAGE},push=true,oci-mediatypes=true` | Buildx image exporter options for `publish`; append `,registry.insecure=true` for a plain-HTTP registry |
| `DOCKER` | `docker` | Docker CLI command |

Examples:

```bash
make TOOLS_VERSION=0.2.0 ENVD_REF=envd-v0.6.13 ARCH=amd64

make \
  ENVD_UPSTREAM_REPO=https://github.com/e2b-dev/infra.git \
  TOOLS_VERSION=0.2.0 \
  ENVD_REF=envd-v0.6.13 \
  ARCH=amd64
```

## Publish

The `publish` target builds a multi-platform artifact and pushes it to `IMAGE`
with OCI media types: the node unpacks the image with `umoci`, which rejects a
Docker v2 manifest. Use a `docker-container` builder (`BUILDX_BUILDER=<name>`);
the `docker` driver ignores the media type request on some engines.
It accepts SemVer releases and prereleases without build metadata, requires the
image tag to match that version, and refuses to overwrite a tag found by its
preflight check. That check is not atomic: the registry must enforce immutable
tags to prevent concurrent or external publishers from replacing a release.

```bash
make publish \
  TOOLS_VERSION=0.2.0 \
  ENVD_REF=envd-v0.6.13 \
  IMAGE=ghcr.io/kvcache-ai/agentenv-tools:0.2.0

make publish \
  TOOLS_VERSION=0.2.0-custom.1 \
  ENVD_REF=envd-v0.6.13 \
  IMAGE=registry.example.com/custom/agentenv-tools:0.2.0-custom.1
```

After validation, update `[tools].version` in `config/deps_manifest.toml` to
the newly published version. Git revisions and OCI digests remain release
provenance; snapshots persist only `TOOLS_VERSION`.

## Local Verification

To test a locally built tools drive, point AgentENV at the generated ext4:

```toml
[tools]
version = "0.2.0"
drive_path = "tools-image/out/tools-0.2.0-amd64.ext4"
```

The path is resolved relative to the server process working directory, not
relative to this README. Setup imports the file into the immutable versioned
directory under `deps_path`; changing its contents requires a new version.

Root filesystem resizing is performed by the host-side `overlaybd-resize`
binary installed from the OverlayBD package under `deps_path`; it is not part
of this guest tools drive.
